# Game Thoughts

## 1. Introduction

 The purpose of this markdown document is for me to have a place to write down things that I like and dislike about games as I play them.  The intention is to be able to reference this document as I think about and build my own games.  If I make a game or system similar to an existing one I have played, I can reference this document to avoid pitfalls, find places of improvement, and remember things that stood out as fun or user friendly that I would also like to incorporate into my own work.
